<i>LILY:
Marshall's almost here.</i>

Yes! Look at us,
hanging out again.

This is amazing.
This is awesome!

- This is... (roaring)
- (laughing): Okay.

- Just settle down, buddy.
- No!

Settling down is for losers with
kids who never go out anymore.

I am in charge tonight, and the earliest
I am allowing anyone to go home is...

- 2:00 a.m.
- 10:00 p.m. - 9:45.

3:00 a.m.

Guys, tonight is
gonna be legen--

wait for it...

If I leave now, I could
put the kids to bed.

- I'll get the check.
- ...dary!

Legendary!

Guys, the gang is back!
We're back!

(sputtering, shouting)

All of us except
for Robin.

We never see her anymore.

Okay, in addition to you guys not
going home before 4:00 a.m.--

yes, it's up to 4:00
now-- new rule:

Anytime anyone talks
about something sad,

we stay out an extra hour.

We said we'd always be
there for the big moments.

- 5:00 a.m.
- To be fair,

tonight's just us hanging
out until 10:00 p.m., tops.

- It's not a big moment.
- BARNEY: Um, yes, it is.

Um, no, it's not.

- Um, yes, it is.
- Um... no, it's not.

Um, yes, it is.

I got a phone call today.

A judge in Queens
is retiring, so...

I'm gonna be a judge.

- (gasps)
- (shouting)

Yes! Yes!

- (laughing)
- Judge Eriksen!

- Yeah!
- (chuckling) One more.

I told you the phone would
ring. You deserve this.

Thanks, Lily.

- I love you, Marshmallow.
- TED: Oh.

1:45 a.m.

Well, you were right, Barney,
this night was, in fact,

- legendary, but... - I know what
you're gonna say and I agree.

We're going to Vegas!

TED: I will be awakened by
screaming children in less than...

(crying):
Four-and-a-half hours.

- BARNEY: You're staying.
- I'm going.

Judge Fudge, your
very first ruling?

- (deep voice): He stays.
- Hey! See?

Tonight is about celebrating
our enduring bond as friends.

Nay, family. Because
that's what we are, Ted.

We are fa...

Okay, fun night,
guys. Keep in touch.

Damn it, Barney.
(choking)

(strained):
Crushing... windpipe.

You're lucky that's the
only pipe I'm crushing.

- Aah! - That woman
is half your age.

Haven't you changed,
even a little?

No. I haven't.

Look, I know
there was a time

when it seemed like I was capable
of going the distance, but...

if it wasn't gonna
happen with Robin,

then it's just not gonna
happen with anyone.

I am never gonna be a
guy who meets a girl

and, from the first time
I see her, I'm just like,

"You are the
love of my life.

"Everything I have and everything
I am is yours forever."

- Really? - No, I'm just making
a point. Move it along.

That's not me.

I'm the guy who straightens his
tie, says something dirty,

high-fives himself and then goes
and talks to that girl over there.

That's me.

Can I please...
just be me?

Judge Fudge?

I'll allow it.

Then I'll a-plow it.
Self-five.

Stinson out.

(rock music playing)

- (cheering)
- Oh!

(whoops)

MARSHALL: Hey, so are you guys ever
gonna tie the knot or are you...

are you just comfortable
living in sin?

Someone's gotten a bit...

- judge-y.
- Oh!

- Sustained.
- THE MOTHER: Yeah.

We'll get around to it. It's just, you
know, with life and jobs and kids.

Plus, this one's still insisting on
getting married in a French castle.

I'd get married tomorrow
in a White Castle,

but this guy needs
more "wow factor."

You're all the wow
factor I need.

BARNEY:
Aw!

(mimics retching)

Glad someone can be happy
on the day of a tragedy.

LILY: Aw, Barney, you know
this is all fake, right?

That robot's
not really dead.

(laughter)

I'm not talking about the
robot, Lily. Everyone,

stop having fun! I'm about
to tell a sad story!

Guys, remember back in 2010
when I achieved a perfect week?

Seven girls in seven
nights, sure.

BARNEY: Well, recently,
I decided to attempt...

a perfect month.

<i>I put together a
brand-new playbook.</i>

No, I can't hear this.
This is just too sad.

But I haven't gotten
to the sad part yet.

You're in your 40s and
you have a playbook.

That's the sad part.

Lily... just...

Okay?

So I put together a
brand-new playbook,

filled with plays I'd never
tried before, like...

<i>...where, as in
the '80s classic,</i>

<i>I magically come to life,
if you know what I mean.</i>

<i>...where I wait till a girl
mentions something she likes.</i>

God, I love nachos.

Thank you.

Allow me to introduce myself.

My name is Jim,

Jim Nacho.

Inventor of the nacho.

So... did you get
a perfect month?

Yes.

Then why are you so upset?

That last girl,
number 31...

Oh, that's a pretty name.
What is that, French?

...she's pregnant.

Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

Wait, you're messing
with us, right?

You didn't really get
a girl pregnant?

It's real. She's pregnant.

Kinda puts an asterisk, on the
whole perfect month thing, huh?

Barney, are you okay?

Ah, Jim Nantz.

Thank goodness. You're always
here for me in times of trouble.

What should I do?

You're on your own
this time, bro.

- Congratulations, Papa.
- Stop it. This is a disaster.

- Why?
- Why? Because I'm too old.

I was about to enter my golden
years, my Clooney years,

my daddy issues years,

where I don't just remind
messed-up girls of their dads

because I'm emotionally distant. I freaking
look like their dads. That's the dream.

My life is over.

So where are you
guys registered?

<i>TED: Another fun fact about the
Goliath National Bank building,</i>

the sleek but historical
facade has been described

<i>by Architecture Vision Monthly
 as "modern classicism."</i>

- I can see that.
- Mm-hmm.

- Any questions from the group?
- I have a question.

What happened to the building that
used to be here? It was way nicer.

Robin! Oh, my God!

What are you doing here?
I thought you were in...

Greece, uh,
Morocco, Moscow.

Yeah, World Wide News
keeps me pretty busy.

And pretty famous.

- I mean, you're everywhere.
- I am not everywhere. The...

Okay, I'm some places.

(laughs):
Hi, Penny.

Oh, my gosh, I haven't
seen you in forever.

- I like you, bus lady.
- Oh, I like you, too.

Never call me that again.

(giggles)

And that was it.

- Wow.
- Hm.

A genuine Scherbatsky
sighting out in nature.

At this point, that's
like seeing Sasquatch.

No, Sasquatch is a warm
and affectionate creature.

At this point, Robin's more
like the yeti-- cold and aloof.

Hey, Ted.

Ask me if the Abominable
Snowman called.

- Has the Abominable Snowman
called? - Not yeti.

Here we are again.

Another big moment for us,
and Robin's missing it.

MARSHALL:
I know, baby.

I mean, the birth of her
ex-husband's love child

is a bit of a stretch--
but I know, baby.

(sighs)

Well?

It was... crazy
in there, but...

I threw up, and now
I feel better.

- Where were you?
- In the can.

I knew I was gonna urp, so I
put this on over my suit.

Number 31 won't let me
in the delivery room.

We're gonna need a
name eventually.

Mr. Stinson?

- Yes?
- Congratulations.

Congratulations because the blood test
came back and I'm not the father?!

Happy Not a Father's Day!

No. Congratulations.

It's a girl.

Would you like
to meet her?

- Nah, I'm good. I don't...
- Oh, just go meet your daughter!

This is Ellie.

I'll give you
guys a minute.

♪

You are the love
of my life.

(trembling breath)

Everything I have...

and everything I am...

...is yours.

(gasping breath)

Forever.

What?

Do I have stuff
in my teeth?

Give me your
engagement ring back.

Just because I have
stuff in my teeth?

- We-we can work through this.
- (laughs): Just give it back.

(clears throat)

Five years is past the statute
of limitations on proposals.

If you don't get married in that
time, you have to re-propose.

- Will you...
- Yes. Yes, you silly man.

Let me finish.

- Will you...
- Yes! Sorry.

- Yes.
- Will y...

Will you marry me...

on Thursday? I called your office--
you got nothing on Thursday.

Will you marry
me on Thursday?

Yes.

(laughs)

(groans)

Same ring.

(laughs)

<i>LILY:
I can't believe it.</i>

It's Ted Mosby's
wedding day!

Yes! After only seven
years and two kids.

Guys, am I rushing
into this?

- Whoa.
- Oh, buddy, are you okay?

So tired.

Baby no sleepy.

Barney dying.

Well, we're staying out
till 3:00 a.m. tonight.

9:45!

Seriously, though, I
am so proud of you.

Not that you're a dad.
It's like you're a totally

- different pers...
- Whoa!

And... we're back.

Hey.

- Hi.
- What to join us for shots?

(chuckles):
Shots?

Before lunch
on a Thursday?

<i>It's like you're trying
to make bad decisions.</i>

You young ladies
need to go home,

put on some decent clothes and take
a good hard look at your lives.

Get!

Call your parents-- they're
probably worried sick.

I have officially
seen everything.

Not everything.

- Hi.
- Hi.

I-I know I've... missed
a couple lately, but...

we said we'd always be
there for the big moments.

Aw, crap.

Mascara running.

Nobody let her
out of your sight.

- Hi, Daddy.
- Whoa.

Look, Robin, I'm really
happy to see you,

but I don't think of you
that way anymore.

No, dummy, you had a kid.

- Congrats.
- Right, yeah. Thanks. A kid.

- I'm tired.
- Oh.

But, uh, she's awesome.

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

Daddy's home.

Mm.

- Judge Fudge? Hey?
- (laughs) Hey...

Actually, um, little
announcement for everybody.

I'm gonna be running
for State Supreme Court.

Yeah. So if everything goes
well, in a couple of months,

you won't be calling me
Judge Fudge anymore.

You'll be calling me
Fudge Supreme.

(others chuckling)

The man of the hour.

Yeah. You RSVP'd no.

I did.

But someone pretty persuasive
talked me into it.

Sorry. I know it's bad luck to
see the bride in her dress.

Worth it.

But I couldn't miss this.

I want to get a picture. Get in! I
want to take a picture of you guys.

Are you ready? All right, get in.

Hey. Hey, you kids.

<i>Yeah, you didn't sound
a thousand there.</i>

Do you have any idea what happened
right here in this very bar?

No. What happened?

(chuckles)

Just...

...just all kinds of stuff.

- A toast.
- Mm-hmm.

Okay, first off... to
everyone at this table...

...I love you guys so
much, I can't even...

- Just move to the second part.
- Okay, okay. Secondly,

OTHERS:
...Evelyn Mosby.

Thank you for that.

A man with...

more emotional endurance
than anyone I know.

It was a long,
difficult road.

Thank God we
finally got here.

- Hear, hear.
- OTHERS: Hear, hear.

<i>NARRATOR:
Aunt Lily wasn't wrong.</i>

This is a story about how you're
totally in love with Aunt Robin.

And you're thinking
about asking her out,

and you want to know
if we're okay with it.

I can't believe this.

I kept this story short
and to the point,

and you guys
still missed it.

The point of the
story is that...

Is that you totally, totally, totally
have the hots for Aunt Robin.

- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

You're grounded.

Wow, you are really
into Aunt Robin.

You're grounded, too.

dinner, you guys are so obvious.

Come on, Dad.
